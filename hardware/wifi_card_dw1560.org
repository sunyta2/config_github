you have to know what you're doing.
worked out of the box with proper kexts and kext patches. Perfect hackintosh part for Dell E5450
This NGFF M.2 WiFi card delivers both fast WiFi and Bluetooth speeds. Only thing is Handoff and Continuity are basicallly non-functional but thatâ€™s considered extra features by me. The base capabilities (AC Wifi and 4.0 BT) work just fine!
