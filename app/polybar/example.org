Download the polybar-<version>.tar for the version you want to build from the release page, extract it with tar xvf polybar-<version>.tar and go into the extracted folder. There, run the following commands:

$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make -j$(nproc)
$ sudo make install

There's also a helper script available in the root folder:

$ ./build.sh
Install the example configuration
Run the following inside the build directory:

$ make userconfig
Or you can copy the example config from /usr/share/doc/polybar/config or /usr/local/share/doc/polybar/config (depending on your install parameters)

Launch the example bar
$ polybar example
