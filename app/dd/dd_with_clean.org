dd if=<source> of=<target> [Options]
Only superuser can run this command because you can face a big data loss due to its improper usage.

# dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sda2 bs=512 count=1
1+0 records in
1+0 records out
512 bytes copied, 0.0116875 s, 43.8 kB/s


You can wipe a disk is done by writing new data over every single bit. To further complicate the recovering process we will write over the entire drive with random data.
# dd if=/dev/urandom of=/dev/sda2 bs=4096


# shred -v --random-source=/dev/urandom -n10 /dev/sda2
# shred -vfz -n 10 /dev/sda2
-f changes permissions to allow writing if needed
-n  (iterations=N) overwrites N times instead of the default (3)
-s (size=N) specifies the number of bytes to shred
-u truncates and removes files after overwriting
-v shows verbose information about the progress
-x does not round file sizes up to the next full block
-z adds a final overwrite with zeros to hide shredding
-u removes the file after overwriting


# yum install wipe

# scrub -p dod /dev/sda5 -f
