This looks like you've turned on iedit-mode (by default toggled using C-;)
See screenshot: https://i.imgur.com/xYPQS1T.png

I copied the upper highlighted region and must have hit some keys by accident. It seems to have activated a mode where I'm editing two regions at the same time.
If I type something in the lower highlighted region, it mirrors the edit in the corresponding spot in the upper region.

I'm interested cause it looks useful, but I can't figure what I did to activate it. Anyone know what this is called?
