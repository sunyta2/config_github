[search - Searching for marked (selected) text in Emacs - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/202803/searching-for-marked-selected-text-in-emacs#203026)
Another option I use quite often is C-s C-w to search for the word after the current mark. Hitting C-w repeatedly increases the search with additional words 
(e.g., C-s C-w C-w C-w searches for the 3 words after the current mark).
Similarly, C-s M-s C-e searches for the rest of the line after the current mark and C-s C-M-y searches for the character after the mark. These are both repeatable in the same way (the former by somewhat-awkwardly repeating M-s C-e after C-s).


Likewise, C-r C-w searches backward ("r" = reverse) for the word after the mark. And C-r C-w C-w searches backward for the two words after the mark. – dougkramer Feb 5 '15 at 7:44

This should be the accepted answer. – Bogdan Calmac Jun 25 '16 at 19:15

The function C-s C-y used to be bound to is now bound to C-s M-s C-e (since Emacs 24.1)



* rgrep lgrep
rgrep is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in
‘grep.el’.

(rgrep REGEXP &optional FILES DIR CONFIRM)

Recursively grep for REGEXP in FILES in directory tree rooted at DIR.
The search is limited to file names matching shell pattern FILES.
FILES may use abbreviations defined in ‘grep-files-aliases’, e.g.
entering ‘ch’ is equivalent to ‘*.[ch]’.  As whitespace triggers
completion when entering a pattern, including it requires
quoting, e.g. ‘C-q<space>’.

With C-u prefix, you can edit the constructed shell command line
before it is executed.
With two C-u prefixes, directly edit and run ‘grep-find-command’.

Collect output in a buffer.  While the recursive grep is running,
you can use C-x ` (M-x next-error), or RET in the grep output buffer,
to visit the lines where matches were found.  To kill the job
before it finishes, type C-c C-k.

This command shares argument histories with M-x lgrep and M-x grep-find.

When called programmatically and FILES is nil, REGEXP is expected
to specify a command to run.

lgrep is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in
‘grep.el’.

(lgrep REGEXP &optional FILES DIR CONFIRM)

Run grep, searching for REGEXP in FILES in directory DIR.
The search is limited to file names matching shell pattern FILES.
FILES may use abbreviations defined in ‘grep-files-aliases’, e.g.
entering ‘ch’ is equivalent to ‘*.[ch]’.  As whitespace triggers
completion when entering a pattern, including it requires
quoting, e.g. ‘C-q<space>’.

With C-u prefix, you can edit the constructed shell command line
before it is executed.
With two C-u prefixes, directly edit and run ‘grep-command’.

Collect output in a buffer.  While grep runs asynchronously, you
can use C-x ` (M-x next-error), or RET in the grep output buffer,
to go to the lines where grep found matches.

This command shares argument histories with M-x rgrep and M-x grep.

[linux - How can I recursively find all files in current and subfolders based on wildcard matching? - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5905054/how-can-i-recursively-find-all-files-in-current-and-subfolders-based-on-wildcard#5905066)
find . -type f -name "*.conf"
find / -iname '*C*.xml'   2>&1 | grep -v "Permission denied"
find . -name "*.wanted" | xargs wc -l
sudo updatedb
And, to use it to look for some particular file type

locate filename
updates db at 1AM would look like:
0 1 * * * updatedb

Or, to look for filename or patter from within current directory, you can type:

 pwd | xargs -n 1 -I {} locate "filepattern"

find-dired is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in
‘find-dired.el’.

(find-dired DIR ARGS)

Run ‘find’ and go into Dired mode on a buffer of the output.
The command run (after changing into DIR) is essentially

    find . \( ARGS \) -ls

except that the car of the variable ‘find-ls-option’ specifies what to
use in place of "-ls" as the final argument.

[forward]





find-grep is an alias for ‘grep-find’ in ‘grep.el’.

(find-grep COMMAND-ARGS)

Run grep via find, with user-specified args COMMAND-ARGS.
Collect output in a buffer.
While find runs asynchronously, you can use the C-x ` command
to find the text that grep hits refer to.

This command uses a special history list for its arguments, so you can
easily repeat a find command.
