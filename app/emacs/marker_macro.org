* macro 의 실용적인 사용법 
; 출처: 
Do you want the command to be executed automatically, 
or just entered into the command line in preparation?

M-x append-to-buffer RET will enter the selected text into the specified buffer at point, 
but the command would not be executed by the shell.

A wrapper function for that could automatically choose *shell* for the buffer
 (or more smartly select/prompt based on current buffers in shell-mode), and then call append-to-buffer.

You could trivially record a keyboard macro to copy the region,
 switch to *shell*, yank, and enter (if required).
