My guess is that you have set up Emacs to save your session and have accumulated hundreds of buffers in various modes.

Try C-x C-b and clean up using d (to mark buffers for deletion) and x (to delete buffers marked in that manner).

@user18816 Yes. You were right. There are literally hundreds of buffers in various modes. C-x C-b d x is going to cumbersome. midnight-mode seems to be a better option. – deshmukh Mar 20 '18 at 11:12
@deshmukh just in case it is not obvious, you can mark multiple buffers with d and then delete them all with a single x, you don't need to alternate d and x. – icarus Mar 20 '18 at 12:37
