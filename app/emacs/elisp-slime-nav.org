Slime allows very convenient navigation to the symbol at point (using M-.), and the ability to pop back to previous marks (using M-,).

This plugin provides similar navigation for Emacs Lisp, supporting navigation to the definitions of variables, functions, libraries and faces.

Additionally, elisp-slime-nav provides a way to describe the symbol at point, whatever its type. As with slime-describe-symbol, this functionality is bound both to C-c C-d d and C-c C-d C-d by default.

Installation
Manual
Ensure elisp-slime-nav.el is in a directory on your load-path, and add the following to your ~/.emacs or ~/.emacs.d/init.el:

(require 'elisp-slime-nav)
(dolist (hook '(emacs-lisp-mode-hook ielm-mode-hook))
  (add-hook hook 'elisp-slime-nav-mode))
