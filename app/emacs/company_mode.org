You have to run company-files for file completion. You can bind a different map for the files completion completion with

(define-key global-map (kbd "C-.") 'company-files)
Also make sure you have the company-files in company-backends (M-x > customize-group > company > company backends)

위의 명령을 실행하기에 앞서 global-company-mode를 실행해야 함. global-company-mode
help:company-backends
You can use mode hooks to specify a different set of backends for different major modes. For example:

(add-hook 'org-mode-hook
          (lambda ()
            (setq-local company-backends '((company-files company-dabbrev)))))

(add-hook 'emacs-lisp-mode-hook
          (lambda ()
            (setq-local company-backends '((company-capf company-dabbrev-code)))))
필요에 따라서 설정을 변경할 수 있다.
