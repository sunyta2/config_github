Diff mode defined in ‘diff-mode.el’:
Major mode for viewing/editing context diffs.
Supports unified and context diffs as well as (to a lesser extent)
normal diffs.

When the buffer is read-only, the ESC prefix is not necessary.
If you edit the buffer manually, diff-mode will try to update the hunk
headers for you on-the-fly.

You can also switch between context diff and unified diff with C-c C-u,
or vice versa with C-c C-d and you can also reverse the direction of
a diff with R.
