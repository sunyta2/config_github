You can [mapc] a function across a sequence, 
so e.g. write a cleanup function that does a find-file on a filename and then applies whitespace-cleanup and whatever else you want. 

Then create a list of the files that you want to apply it to: 
(setq my-file list '("file1" "file2" ....)) 
    and then apply the cleanup function on each file with 
(mapc '#my-cleanup-function my-filelist).
