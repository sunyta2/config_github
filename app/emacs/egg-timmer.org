(require 'egg-timer)
(global-set-key (kbd "C-s-a") #'egg-timer-schedule)
If you'd like to customize the intervals that egg-timer.el uses, the variable egg-timer-intervals should suffice. For example, if you'd like to support a timer for 3 hours:

(setq egg-timer-intervals (add-to-list 'egg-timer-intervals '("3 hour" . 180)))
If you'd like to create a keybinding to immediately schedule an alarm instead of being prompted for a list of options, use egg-timer-do-schedule:

(global-set-key (kbd "C-s-a") (lambda () (interactive) (egg-timer-do-schedule 2)))
