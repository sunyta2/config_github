Another great video.  A Vim user for 20-some years, I
 got into Emacs over a year ago, hooked by Aaron Bieber's Vim meetup on Emacs, and found Org and Magit addictive.  
So much so I created my own config as Spacemacs wasn't cutting it for me (a couple bugs), 
but I still configured with evil as I'm so used to my Vim bindings and work didn't permit me to take a lot of time to get used to an entire new muscle memory. Unfortunately, I have to use Windows for work, and cannot get Admin privs to the laptop, so it's difficult to change Emacs configs on the fly--much easier to do that on Linux
