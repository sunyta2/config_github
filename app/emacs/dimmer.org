    Archive: melpa

     Commit: e13541621e6fa82510fd5cb6ff029c1a134d0bfc
    Summary: Visually highlight the selected buffer
   Requires: emacs-25.1
   Homepage: https://github.com/gonewest818/dimmer.el
   Keywords: faces editing 
Other versions: 20200308.2331 (installed).

This module provides a minor mode that indicates which buffer is
currently active by dimming the faces in the other buffers.  It
does this nondestructively, and computes the dimmed faces
dynamically such that your overall color scheme is shown in a muted
form without requiring you to define what is a "dim" version of
every face.

`dimmer.el' can be configured to adjust foreground colors (default),
background colors, or both.

Usage:

     (require 'dimmer)
     (dimmer-mode t)
     (setq dimmer-fraction 0.2) ;; dimmer.org basic value
     (dimmer-configure-which-key)
     (dimmer-configure-helm)

Configuration:

By default dimmer excludes the minibuffer and echo areas from
consideration, so that most packages that use the minibuffer for
interaction will behave as users expect.
