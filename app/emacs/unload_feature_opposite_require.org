There's no built-in way to do this--see Unloading in the Elisp manual.

unload-feature takes a force argument that allows forcibly unloading P even if other packages depend on P; is that sufficient for your needs?

If not, you can try to create a recursive version of unload-feature containing:

(let* ((file (feature-file feature))
       (dependents (delete file (copy-sequence (file-dependents file))))) 
  (when dependents
    (mapc #'unload-feature-recursive (mapcan #'file-provides dependents))))
