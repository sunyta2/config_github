    Summary: Ivy client for clipmenu
   Requires: emacs-26.1, f-0.20.0, s-1.12.0, dash-2.16.0, ivy-0.13.0
   Homepage: https://github.com/wpcarro/ivy-clipmenu.el
Other versions: 20200302.1419 (installed).

Ivy integration with the clipboard manager, clipmenu.  Essentially, clipmenu
turns your system clipboard into a list.

To use this module, you must first install clipmenu and ensure that the
clipmenud daemon is running.  Refer to the installation instructions at
https://github.com/cdown/clipmenu for those details.

This module intentionally does not define any keybindings since I'd prefer
not to presume my users' preferences.  Personally, I use EXWM as my window
manager, so I call `exwm-input-set-key' and map it to `ivy-clipmenu-copy'.
